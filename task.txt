Imagine a cozy, festive website decked with snowflakes and twinkling lights, where every visitor is greeted with a cheery holiday prompt upon entering:
🎄 "Season's greetings! What flavors of froyo would you like to enjoy today? Simply type them in, separated by commas, and let us whip up a winter wonderland of flavors just for you!" 🎄

The visitor, filled with holiday cheer, types in: "vanilla,vanilla,vanilla,strawberry,coffee,coffee" and presses enter.

With a little holiday magic (and a peek at the browser console), a festive table appears, showing exactly how many of each froyo flavor they’ve chosen:

🎅 Froyo Flavor Totals: 🎅

Vanilla: 3 servings
Coffee: 2 servings
Strawberry: 1 serving
The visitor now sees their custom holiday froyo list, neatly counted and ready to enjoy! 🎁
